<p>In the year 1674, by Grant of Lord Culpeper, a tract of 5,000 acres situated on the
west bank of the Potomac River, fifteen miles south of the present city of Washington,
became the property of John Washington and Nicholas Spencer. Half of this
tract, or 2,500 acres, descended to Lawrence Washington, who, in 1743, built a residence,
and named the estate Mount Vernon, after the British Admiral under whom he
had served. At Lawrence Washington&rsquo;s death (1752) the estate passed to the ownership
of his half brother, George Washington, who subsequently extended the boundaries
of his plantation until they included nearly 8,000 acres.</p>
<p>In 1799, when George Washington died, the property passed as a life interest to
his widow, by whose will most of the household effects in the Mansion were, after her
death, divided among her four grandchildren. Thus was the original furniture of
Mount Vernon eventually scattered.</p>
<p>Bushrod Washington, John Augustine Washington, and John A. Washington,
Jr., followed in succession as owners of Mount Vernon.</p>
<p>These gentlemen furnished the Mansion according to their individual tastes and
made such minor changes as papering or painting the interior to preserve it.</p>
<p>Mr. John A. Washington, Jr., the last-named owner, in accordance with the wishes
of his family, to effect a permanent preservation of the property, offered to sell it to
the National Government. This project failed, as did likewise an attempt to sell to
the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
<p>At this juncture the Mount Vernon Ladies&rsquo; Association of the Union was (in 1856)
organized by Miss Pamela Cunningham, of South Carolina. Her appeal to the
patriotism of all American women (December, 1853) resulted in the accomplishment
of her noble project in spite of many obstacles. The purchase money was raised by
contributions from thirty-three States of the Union, materially aided by Hon. Edward
Everett, of Massachusetts, in lecturing for the benefit of the Mount Vernon Fund,
his contributions amounting to $68,294.59. In 1858, this Association was thus enabled

to buy from Mr. John A. Washington, Jr., and his heirs, 202 acres of the Mount
Vernon estate, including the Tomb, the Mansion, attendant buildings, the wharf, etc.,
the price paid being $200,000 and interest.</p>
<p>In 1887, an important addition of 33&frac12; acres was achieved through the generosity
of the late Mr. Jay Gould, of New York; in 1893 Mr. Christian Heurich, of Washington,
D. C., gave three acres, and in 1925 Mr. and Mrs. Hugh McK. Landon, of
Indianapolis, kindly donated about 23 acres more, thus making the total area owned
by the Mt. Vernon Ladies&rsquo; Association approximately 260 acres.</p>
<p>Among the many who visit Mount Vernon few are aware of what an expensive
undertaking is involved in its restoration and preservation, nor do they realize on
entering its gates that they, too, contribute their mite toward the maintenance of this
historic place. To retain the appearance of that simplicity which characterized the
home life of Washington, to preserve the reverence of his hallowed shrine and at the
same time meet the protective requirements incident to increasing wear and tear,
has been a problem to be mastered.</p>

<p>While the employment of modern appliances has become a necessity, they are
masked as much as possible to avoid glaring contrast with the more primitive methods
of olden times. For instance: to guard against accidents by fire all former and dangerous
means of heating the buildings have given place to a hot water system, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
mains of which pass through subterranean conduits from a distant (underground)
boiler room, and all buildings are lighted by a system of low voltage electricity installed
under the direction of Mr. Edison.</p>
<p>Fire engines&mdash;both chemical and steam&mdash;are at hand for instant use, and guards
are on constant watch both day and night. Powerful modern pumps (electrically
driven) supply water from an artesian well for household purposes, and keep the
emergency reservoirs filled. Sanitary drainage is an essential improvement. Bogs
and swamps have been reclaimed to make the place more healthful.</p>
<p>Threatening landslides near the Mansion and old Tomb were averted by the costly
expedient of tunneling the hill to drain the water-bearing sands, the source of disastrous
surface movements which had caused Washington much alarm.</p>
<p>The Association owes to the interest and patriotism of Prof. Charles Sprague
Sargent, of Arnold Arboretum, the replacement and listing of many trees planted at
Mount Vernon during Washington&rsquo;s lifetime. A plan with the position of all historic
trees is shown in the guide book. Successful efforts have been made to replant both
the grounds of the Mansion and the surrounding woods according to Washington&rsquo;s
original idea as expressed in his diary.</p>
<p>The repair and safeguarding of buildings and their contents, attention to the
old trees Washington loved, his roads, walks, gardens and grounds, continually tax
the energy and resources of the Association. That the steadfast aim and purpose, thus
successfully achieved, is appreciated by those who are familiar with it, is admirably
expressed in the concluding chapter of Owen Wister&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seven Ages of Washington.&rdquo;
The following is a brief quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Everything, every subject, every corner and step, seems to bring him
close. It is an exquisite and friendly serenity which bathes one&rsquo;s sense,
that seems to be charged all through with some meaning or message of beneficence
and reassurance, but nothing that could be put in words. Turn into his
garden and look at the walls and walks he planned, the box hedges, the trees,
the flower beds, the great order and the great sweetness everywhere. You may
spend an hour, you may spend a day, wandering, sitting, feeling this gentle
power of the place; you may come back another time, it meets you, you cannot
dispel it by familiarity. And as you think of this you bless the devotion
of those whose piety and care treasure the place and keep it sacred and
beautiful.</i></p>

<p>Through this gateway Washington and his guests were accustomed to pass
from the main road. The original paving of cobble stones has been found intact
and now visitors to Mount Vernon enter as in Washington&rsquo;s time. An attractive
bowling-green extends from the gateway nearly to the Mansion. To the left are the
flower gardens, and occupying a similar area to the right is the kitchen garden. These
gardens are surrounded by brick walls, the coping of which was restored, in 1895, by
Mrs. Christine Blair Graham, late Vice-Regent for Missouri.</p>
<p>Many of the old trees still bordering the original driveway have been identified
from Washington&rsquo;s diary as having been planted by him or his guests. Notably
among them may be seen, near the Flower Garden entrance, two handsome tulip
poplars&mdash;the tallest trees of the group.</p>
<p>On the lawn facing the Potomac are three large pecan trees which, as seedlings,
came from Thomas Jefferson and were planted by Washington.</p>

<p>The west front of the Mansion was the point of approach for visitors, as indicated
by the large central door bearing the original brass knocker. On this side is a
spacious court, flanked by several frame buildings&mdash;to the right, the kitchen, butler&rsquo;s
house, smoke-house, laundry and coach house, while to the left are the office, the
gardener&rsquo;s house, carpenter shop and spinning house.</p>
<p>The kitchen and office are joined to the main building by colonnades, which were
rebuilt in 1874 by the combined efforts of the late Vice-Regents for six States, as
follows: Mrs. Hannah Blake Farnsworth, Michigan; Miss Lily Lytle Macalester,
Pennsylvania; Miss Emily L. Harper, Maryland; Mrs. Lucy H. Pickens, South
Carolina; Mrs. Maria Brooks, New York, and Mrs. Nancy Wade Halstead, New
Jersey.</p>
<p>The sun-dial in the center of the court marks where one stood in the days of
Washington. The posts and chains are a restoration of an original feature, accomplished
in 1917 by the Vice-Regent for Oregon.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1892, when the Electric Railway located its terminal station near the north
boundary of the estate, an entrance at that point had to be arranged for visitors.
It is called the North Lodge Gate to distinguish it from the private entrance half a
mile away. To provide an appropriate walkway to and from the Mansion, funds were
raised, in 1894, by the late Vice-Regent for Pennsylvania&mdash;Mrs. Lippincott&mdash;and
stone flagging laid the entire distance of 1,100 feet.</p>
<p>In 1900 the Vice-Regent for Texas, with financial aid from Masons and other
patriotic citizens of her State, erected the present lodges and gateway.</p>
<p>The Vice-Regent for Texas and Mrs. Charles Denby, late Vice-Regent for
Indiana, in 1905, jointly arranged for the building of a brick wall along the boundary
next the North Lodge Gate, copying walls built elsewhere on the estate by General
Washington.</p>
<p>The gradual extension of this wall is being accomplished through contributions
of individual members of the Association.</p>

<p>This was the main approach, in olden times, from the much-traveled highway
to the homestead, which can be faintly discerned through a vista cleared by
Washington. A carriage road winds through intervening valleys to the Mansion,
nearly a mile distant. Extending from this gateway to the Potomac River is the
part of the estate purchased in 1858 by the Mount Vernon Ladies&rsquo; Association.</p>
<p>In 1890 Mrs. Martha Mitchell, late Vice-Regent for Wisconsin, provided funds
for renovating these ancient lodges which once sheltered Washington&rsquo;s gatekeepers.</p>

<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="Mount Vernon Mansion" width="800" height="598" />
</div>
<p>George Washington enlarged the original residence, built in 1743 by
Lawrence Washington, by increasing its length and height, completing these
improvements in 1786. In construction, its foundation walls are of stone and brick;
the framework oak; the sheathing Virginia pine, cut, painted, and sanded to resemble
stone. The roof is of cypress shingles. A spacious and well-drained cellar underlies
the whole house.</p>
<p>When the Mount Vernon Ladies&rsquo; Association came into possession of this property,
the Mansion and other buildings were found unfurnished and greatly in need of
repairs. The story of the restoration cannot be adequately told in this short sketch.</p>
<p>The work was divided by allotting to each Vice-Regent a room or some other
feature to be restored. Gradually many articles of original furniture and personal
effects of the Washingtons were recovered, some by gift, others by purchase, while
several articles had only been loaned. The work has been attended with gratifying
success and still progresses. Every effort is directed toward the complete restoration
of each feature and condition as it existed in the days of Washington.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ha Ha&rdquo; wall, shown in illustration, was, in 1896, rebuilt upon its original
foundations through funds raised by Miss Amy Townsend, late Vice-Regent for New York.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>Portico</i></span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="Portico" width="800" height="605" />
</div>
<p>The east portico extends the full length of the Mansion, and its roof is supported
by eight square wooden columns reaching a height of two stories. An
ornamental balustrade surmounts the porch roof and adds height to its pleasing effect.
The tiles with which the floor is still paved were imported from England by Washington
and laid in 1786. In 1915, 1512 tiles were obtained from the original quarry
to replace those so badly worn as to be unsafe. The dimensions of the pavement are:
length, 95 feet 5 inches; width, 14 feet 6 inches, and, according to Washington&rsquo;s own
measurements, this pavement is 124 feet 10&frac12; inches above the river level. The columns
and balustrade are faithful reproductions of the original, the foundations of the
building have been strengthened, weakened timbers renewed, and steel girders hidden
between floors and ceiling for increased stability.</p>
<p>In 1895 accurate architectural drawings of interior and exterior details were
secured by Mrs. Mary T. Leiter, late Vice-Regent for Illinois, and placed in safe
deposit vaults in Washington.</p>
<p>In 1909 a skeleton model of the Mansion, showing its unique construction, was
lodged for safe keeping with the National Museum.</p>
<p>The outlook from the porch commands extensive and picturesque views of the
broad Potomac.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Mansion Interior, Central Hall" width="800" height="494" />
</div>
<p>The view of the hall is from the East, showing the main stairway. To the right,
doors open into the Music Room and Parlor; to the left are Mrs. Washington&rsquo;s
Sitting Room and the Family Dining Room. The paneling of the hall is as Washington
improved it in 1775, and the original colors are restored. The pattern
of wall paper above the stairs has been worked out from recently discovered
fragments of what was originally there. The key of the Bastile,
presented to Washington by Lafayette, in 1789, hangs in a glass case
between the doors on the left, while opposite may be seen the brass
hunting horn received from the same friend.</p>
<p>Four of Washington&rsquo;s swords are shown: one he used during the
Braddock campaign; his dress sword (damaged by rust); a sword made
for him at the Solingen Armory in Prussia; the silver-mounted blade
he wore when resigning command of the army (1783) and at his inauguration
in 1789. In the case with the swords is the sash worn by General
Braddock when he was wounded, and given by him to Col. George
Washington, who was then his aide-de-camp.</p>
<p>By his will, Washington bequeathed to each of his nephews one of
his five swords, with the following injunction: &ldquo;Not to unsheathe them
for the purpose of shedding blood except it be in self-defence or in
the defence of their country and its rights, and in the latter case to
keep them unsheathed and prefer falling with them in their hands to
the relinquishment thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07a.jpg" alt="Clock" width="174" height="600" />
</div>
<p>The clock on the stairs belonged to Lawrence Washington, the
founder of Mount Vernon, and the hall lantern was given to him
(1745) by Admiral Vernon, for whom the estate was named.</p>
<p>The marble top table belonged to Washington, and the engravings
are reprints of originals. The restoration of the hall is due to the
Vice-Regents for Michigan and Alabama.</p>

<p>The finish of this room&mdash;its wall panels, mantel and ceiling decoration&mdash;is a
restoration of the original. Washington&rsquo;s coat of arms is carved above the
mantel, and his crest and initials are cast in the heavy fireback. An old painting
empaneled over the mantel is said to represent a part of Admiral
Vernon&rsquo;s fleet at Cartagena, and was sent by the Admiral to Lawrence
Washington in 1743 as an acknowledgment of Washington&rsquo;s courtesy
in naming the estate for him.</p>
<p>The rug in the room is particularly interesting. It was woven
by order of Louis XVI, and sent by him as a present to General
Washington.</p>
<p>The curtain cornices are original, also the mirror, now restored
to its former position between the windows, and two rosewood stands
for vases of flowers.</p>

cupboard may be seen a reproduction of the set of china presented to Mrs. Washington
by the officers of the French fleet. The stucco
ornamentation of the ceiling is the same as
applied in 1775. An iron fireback bearing
the Fairfax coat of arms, stands in the fireplace.
It was at the Fairfax home, &ldquo;Belvoir,&rdquo;
adjoining Mount Vernon. The clock

<p>This well-proportioned room was planned by Washington for the banquet hall,
and this addition, in 1776, completed the enlargement of his house&mdash;now dignified
by the name of Mansion. The decoration throughout is as he designed it; the present
fresh appearance of which is the result of restorations (1884) by Mrs. Justine Van
Renssalaer Townsend, then Vice-Regent for
New York. An attractive feature is the
handsome marble mantel presented to Washington
in 1785 by an English admirer, Mr.
Samuel Vaughan. The model of the Bastile
is made from a stone from the renowned
French prison and was sent over by Lafayette
in 1793. A plateau for ornamenting
his dining table was imported by Washington.
Among original relics recovered for
this room are the clock, candlesticks and
vases, two quaint silver bracket lamps, a footstool
from Washington&rsquo;s pew in Old Trinity
Church, N. Y., and paintings of the Great
Falls of the Potomac. There are portraits
of Washington by Gilbert Stuart and C. W.
Peale, also a supposed portrait of Washington
at the age of twenty-one, recently sent over
from Glasgow as a loan.</p>

<p>A tour of inspection among the several buildings develops points of interest at
every turn. The family kitchen bears evidence, in the proportions of its huge
fireplace with ponderous crane and bake-oven near by, of what feasts were prepared
therein. The interior of this room was renovated by Miss Amy Townsend, late
Vice-Regent for New York, who obtained for it furnishings of contemporaneous
date. The smoke-house stood near, and in season was filled with hams and meats for
smoking. The larder was well stocked, tradition states, as indeed it must have been, to
feed so many guests in addition to the regular household and large retinue of servants.</p>

four prints representing the siege of Gibraltar are those which hung at Mount Vernon
in the days of Washington. The window curtains and hangings are of the type of that
period. A mahogany chair, presented to Washington by Lafayette, is a recent acquisition.
One of the candles moulded for the illumination of Yorktown in 1776 is a relic

<p>This is one of the rooms General Washington added. It was designed for his
study, as shown by the old book shelves built in the wall. Back of opposite doors
were shelf rooms for his maps and manuscripts. The bulk of Washington&rsquo;s library he
bequeathed to Judge Bushrod Washington, from whose nephews the books were
purchased by a syndicate (1848) and deposited in the Boston Athen&aelig;um, where they
still are. Some scattered volumes recovered by the Mount Vernon Ladies&rsquo; Association
include several bearing the genuine signature of George Washington. The names of
his mother and members of his family appear upon others. An ancient Bible presented
to Washington by the Bishop of Sodor and Man, together with twenty volumes of
French History of Travel, sent him by Rochambeau, besides many duplicates of
Washington&rsquo;s books, give interesting character to the present collection. Mrs. Washington&rsquo;s
Prayer Book, and a Family Bible with record of George Washington&rsquo;s birth
and baptism, have lately been acquired.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tambour desk&rdquo; and chair, which Washington used in this room, and left
by his will to Dr. Craik, were purchased and restored to Mount Vernon in 1905.</p>
<p>An original mahogany bookcase and a globe are valued relics. The pictures,
tambour desk and articles of old-fashioned furniture have been assembled by the
Vice-Regent for Massachusetts.</p>
<p>A map of Mount Vernon, and of one of Washington&rsquo;s plantations, carefully
platted by himself, are to be seen here, likewise &ldquo;rubbings&rdquo; of brasses on tombs of the
Washingtons in England.</p>

<p>The room in which Washington died (December 14, 1799) deservedly attracts
special notice. The items of original furniture and personal effects assembled
here add much to the impressive character. A piece associated with Washington&rsquo;s
childhood is his mother&rsquo;s arm chair. Washington&rsquo;s bureau, washstand, mirror, etc.,
are shown. Most prominent of all is the bedstead on which the great and good man
breathed his last.</p>
<p>The mahogany shaving stand presented to Washington by the first French
minister to this country was recently recovered.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s crest and initials are wrought in the old fireback. Above the
mantel hangs an engraving, one of a set of five entitled &ldquo;Sorrows of Werther,&rdquo; which
belonged to the General. The arm chair at the foot of the bed was used in this room
when Washington died.</p>
<p>The two small rooms connecting with the bed-chamber were used respectively
as linen closet and dressing room. Between the doors of these rooms now hangs the
frame of Washington&rsquo;s thermometer.</p>
<p>To the efforts of the late Mrs. Emma Reed Ball, for 44 years the Vice-Regent for
Virginia, is due, in great measure, the restoration of this room.</p>

<p>The only room on the third floor historically interesting is the one in which Mrs.
Washington died. It must be explained that, following a custom then prevalent,
Washington&rsquo;s room was closed after his death, and his widow selected this attic room
because from its only window she could see the tomb where her husband&rsquo;s body lay.
Mrs. Washington died here, May 22, 1802.</p>
<p>Until recently, the only original relics in this room were the washstand presented
by Mrs. Martha Mitchell, late Vice-Regent for Wisconsin, and dressing glass presented
by Mrs. George R. Goldsborough, late Vice-Regent for Maryland. Now have
been added a tea set owned by Mrs. Washington, a christening bowl which belonged
to Mrs. Washington&rsquo;s family&mdash;the Dandriges&mdash;and an old bed quilt believed to have
been used at Mount Vernon.</p>
<p>The care of this room fell to the Vice-Regent for Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Ascending by the stairway, from
the main hall to the second floor,
six bedrooms are found&mdash;the Lafayette
Room, River Room, Guest Chamber,
Nellie Custis Room, Green Room and
Mrs. Washington&rsquo;s Room. These are in
charge of the Vice-Regents representing,
respectively, the following States: New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
West Virginia and Virginia. The
first five rooms contain but little original
furniture, although all the articles are of
historic importance and represent the
correct type of the Colonial period.</p>
<p>In the Nellie Custis Room are a table
cover and footstool embroidered by her.</p>

<p>The four spare rooms on this floor are
furnished appropriately after the
old style, by the Vice-Regents for
District of Columbia, Connecticut, North
Carolina and Maine. Formerly the
Washingtons found these rooms useful
as spare chambers for the accommodation
of guests. The good old custom of
keeping &ldquo;open house&rdquo; attracted to
Mount Vernon hosts of their friends
traveling North and South, and doubtless
the Mansion was often taxed to its fullest
capacity.</p>
<p>In the linen room on this floor may
be seen Washington&rsquo;s military chest, and
camp equipments used by his troops when
serving with General Braddock.</p>
<p>One of the chairs in the room furnished
by Mrs. Mary T. Barnes, the late Vice-Regent
for District of Columbia, belonged
to Washington.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="Flower Garden" width="800" height="492" />
</div>
<p>Among all of the charms and attractions of the home of Washington, not one can
excel the beautiful flower garden&mdash;an ideal spot&mdash;with its memories of General
and Lady Washington who planned it, the prim box hedges indelibly marking the
walks and flower beds now as in the past. Distinguished guests were invited to plant
trees, shrubs and flowers, mementos of their visits, many of which plantings have been
perpetuated. Lafayette and Jefferson have leafy monuments here, while the roses
named by Washington for his mother and Nellie Custis are daily sought by pilgrims.</p>
<p>At the end of the long walk in the garden is a little octagonal structure known as
the school room, in which it is supposed the Custis children were taught their early
lessons.</p>
<p>The greenhouse restorations are due to the efforts of Mrs. Martha Mitchell,
Mrs. Lucy H. Pickens and Miss Mary Lloyd Pendleton, late Vice-Regents, respectively,
for Wisconsin, South Carolina and Ohio.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><i>Servants&rsquo; Quarters</i></span></h2>
<p>Two long, red-roofed buildings adjoin the conservatory. These were the quarters
for a limited number of servants needed at the Mansion. Comfortable cabins
to house the rest of the negroes were located at convenient distances about the plantation.
Both these quarters were in ruins, but have been restored&mdash;the West Quarters
by Mrs. Jennie Meeker Ward, late Vice-Regent for Kansas in 1890, and the East
Quarters by Miss Amy Townsend, late Vice-Regent for New York in 1897. While in
exterior form these buildings are identical with their original appearance, the interior
of each has been somewhat changed to meet existing requirements.</p>

</div>
<p>George Washington&rsquo;s fondness for experimental gardening is shown
by the care with which he arranged these terraced beds for growing small fruits
and vegetables for the use of his household. His diary is evidence enough of the
eagerness with which he selected the best-known seed and exploited, with more or less
success, the latest improvements in horticulture.</p>
<p>Sheltered by the walls he built, scions
of original fig bushes still flourish, while
bordering the cross walk to the gate, the
box hedge he planted has developed to
unusual proportions.</p>

<p>In Washington&rsquo;s day this building was the center of much activity, it being the
all-essential tool-shop for general repairs.</p>
<p>In outward appearance its original character and purpose are still preserved.</p>
<p>Its interior arrangement, however, has been altered to meet the urgent need of a
fireproof repository for valuable records of the Association.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small"><i>The Spinning House</i></span></h2>
<p>The spinning house, north of the court, is where much material was prepared
for clothing the servants, and where rag carpets and other fabrics were woven
for the use of the family. Flax, cotton, wool and silk were there put through the
various processes of spinning and weaving by skilled servants. The old loom, wheels,
reels, and flaxbrake were recovered by Mrs. Rebecca B. Flandrau, late Vice-Regent
for Minnesota, 1892.</p>

</div>
<p>The oldest building here is the barn, erected in 1733 by Washington&rsquo;s father.
The bricks are said to have been brought from England, and they were laid in
strong mortar made of oyster-shell lime. The shingle roof of this building was renewed
in 1874, the cost being shared by all the members of the Association. Substantial
renovations of the interior were effected in 1896-7
by Mrs. William Ames, the late Vice-Regent for Rhode
Island.</p>
<p>Here were stabled the coach horses and saddle horses.
Washington&rsquo;s famous traveling coach, the &ldquo;White Chariot,&rdquo;
as he called it, was kept in the coach house near by. This
coach house was restored in 1894 by the Vice-Regent for
Michigan, who was also instrumental in obtaining (1901)
the ancient vehicle now here, a duplicate of the original
carriage owned by Washington. From well-founded tradition
it is believed that General and Mrs. Washington frequently
rode in this coach.</p>

<p>An original feature restored as Washington had it, was
a &ldquo;Ha Ha&rdquo; wall extending from opposite the barn to the
summer house, also a screen wall flanking the road from
the barn to the kitchen.</p>

<p>On the brow of the steep hillside, south of the Mansion, overlooking the river,
is the summer house. It commands a beautiful view of the broad Potomac,
with the Maryland hills beyond, and doubtless was a favorite resort in &ldquo;ye olden
time.&rdquo; It was restored in 1886, the funds being raised by the Vice-Regent for Louisiana,
Mrs. Ida A. Richardson, through the school children of her State. The deep
cellar under the summer house was intended for an ice house, but it is believed to
have been abandoned as such when another was constructed in a more convenient
locality north of the Mansion.</p>
<p>The wooded slope below the summer house was utilized by Washington for his
deer paddock, which was restored and stocked with Virginia deer, in 1887, by the sons
of the late Mrs. Robert Campbell, Vice-Regent for Missouri.</p>

</div>
<p>Washington shipped much of his farm produce and supplies by water&mdash;and
today are landed at the wharf many pilgrims to the home and tomb
of the &ldquo;Father of His Country.&rdquo; The custom of tolling a bell as a mark of respect to
his memory is hallowed by its observance for more than a
century.</p>
<p>The present covering of the wharf was provided in 1891
by Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst, late Vice-Regent for California.
The parapet for protection of the public was given by the
Vice-Regent for the State of Washington, and the Iron Gates
by the Vice-Regent for Oregon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hearst also caused to be built the substantial stone
sea-wall as a necessary protection to the wooded shore against
wave-wash during storms. This important improvement has
enabled the Association to complete the filling of neighboring
ravines and swamps, thus accomplishing a valuable reclamation
now utilized as meadow land.</p>
<p>From the wharf a road and walk lead to the Tomb and
Mansion.</p>

</div>
<p>On the edge of the hill, midway down the road leading to the wharf, an iron-railed
enclosure marks where Washington&rsquo;s remains rested from 1799 until 1831.
This vault was constructed by George Washington, but later, believing it to be
insecure, he planned another tomb, which his executors built. In April, 1831, all
bodies in the old vault were transferred to the new tomb.</p>
<p>The cause of apprehension as to safety of the old structure, resulting in its
abandonment, was the frequency of landslides near it.</p>
<p>Extensive repairs to the old tomb were made in 1887 by the Vice-Regent for
Michigan. The iron railing was found necessary for protection.</p>
<p>In 1908 the broad flight of brick steps was completely rebuilt, the original material,
suitable for the purpose, being used again.</p>

</div>
<p>This plain statement empaneled above the doorway of the rigidly simple brick
vault at once marks its importance. Within the doubly ironed portals may be
seen two marble sarcophagi; that on the right contains the body of General Washington
and the one on the left the remains of his wife. At the rear of this open vault,
and connected with it through a square iron door, is an inner vault containing the
remains of many of the Washington family. To the memory of Bushrod Washington
and John Augustine Washington, successors of the General (whose bodies are within
the vault), marble shafts were erected in front of the tomb, while to the east are the
graves of Nellie Custis and her daughter.</p>
<p>Washington selected this site for the vault only a few months before he died.
His executors carried out his explicit directions as to construction, which accounts
for its extreme simplicity. Because of Washington&rsquo;s distaste for display, the character
of this tomb should never be changed. Extensive repairs for the preservation of the
original structure were made by the Association in 1886. To this hallowed spot come
pilgrims from every land.</p>

<p>The parish church of Mount Vernon, six miles distant from the Mansion, was
built during the years 1768-70 from the plans drawn by General Washington,
who was a member of the building committee. He was a vestryman of the parish for
twenty years, and for the greater part of that time was a regular attendant at service,
never permitting, as Bishop Meade says, &ldquo;the
weather or company to keep him from church.&rdquo;
Subsequently Washington became connected with
Christ Church, Alexandria, where today his family
pew may be seen as he used it.</p>
<p>Pohick Church, during the Civil War, was
occupied at times by Federal troops and all the
interior furnishings were destroyed. The late Vice-Regent
for Michigan, Mrs. E. B. A. Rathbone,
worked untiringly in the interest of the church, and
to her are due the large additions to its endowment
fund. Through the efforts of Miss Amy Townsend,
former Vice-Regent for New York, both interior and
exterior have been faithfully restored to their original
appearance at the time of Washington.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
